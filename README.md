# SaaS Revenue Intelligence Platform

**Enterprise-style SaaS Revenue Analytics System**  
Built with Python, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Streamlit to model revenue, retention, and customer lifetime value for subscription-based businesses.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project simulates a real SaaS analytics backend, with clean architecture and modular design:

- Containerized ETL pipeline for synthetic SaaS data
- PostgreSQL data warehouse
- Business metric analytics layer
- Interactive executive dashboard
- Advanced retention and survival modeling

It demonstrates techniques and practices used in **enterprise data engineering workflows**.
